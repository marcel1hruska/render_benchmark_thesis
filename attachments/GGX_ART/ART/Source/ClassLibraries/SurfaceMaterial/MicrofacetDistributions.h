    'ArnBlinnMicrofacetDistribution'
 
    Blinn's Microfacet distribution, which in Blinn's original work
    (Siggraph 1977) is designated D1.

    The roughness (for Blinn's Microfacet distribution) is
    controlled by the expression for beta, describing the
    average roughness angle (>0 (smooth)...pi/2 (rough)).

    Following Blinn's original paper (Siggraph 1977), this parameter
    describes the angle where the distribution of microfacets falls off
    to 1/2.
