\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}

This chapter overviews the results of the evaluation of ART renderer --- direct comparison with Mitsuba2. As we've noted before, the fluorescence is exclusive for ART, iridescence for Mitsuba2 and therefore we are not evaluating these as there is no other renderer to compare them with.

\section{Error maps}
The difference images shown in the following sections are created by L2 and MAPE errors maps, both integrated in the JERI framework and consequently in our benchmark.
